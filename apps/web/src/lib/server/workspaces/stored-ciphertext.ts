/**
 * Trying the resolved `SECRET_KEY` against ciphertext this database already
 * holds.
 *
 * The canary in `fingerprint.ts` answers "does this process hold the key the
 * canary was sealed with". Every caller of it needs the stronger claim: "is this
 * the key this database's *existing* ciphertext was written under". Those two
 * questions have the same answer right up until custody changes over a database
 * nobody re-encrypted, at which point the canary is re-stamped under the new key
 * and certifies it over data the new key cannot open.
 *
 * Measured, 2026-08-09: a workspace's auth signing key was sealed under the
 * fleet-wide secret at 14:20; custody moved to a per-workspace key at 14:32 and a
 * fresh canary was stamped under it; pool checkout passed and every
 * authenticated request 500'd on the stale value for eighteen hours. Nothing in
 * the check was wrong — it was answering a question nobody was asking.
 *
 * So the check gets a second, independent fact: a real sample of the workspace's
 * own ciphertext, opened with the key that is about to be put into service.
 *
 * ## Why `jwks.private_key` and nothing else
 *
 * Several things are encrypted at rest — integration OAuth bundles, webhook
 * signing secrets, connector secrets, app signing secrets — and
 * every one of them goes through `encryption.ts`, which derives its key with
 * HKDF over *the active workspace namespace and a purpose string*. Reproducing that
 * derivation here would mean this module reconstructing, before the workspace scope
 * exists, the exact namespace and purpose each row was written under. Get it
 * wrong and the sample fails to open under the correct key: a false refusal, an
 * outage, and a worse failure than the silent one being fixed.
 *
 * The auth signing key is the exception. The `jwt()` plugin seals it with the
 * master secret **directly** (`secret: activeSecretKey()`), through the auth
 * library's own `symmetricEncrypt`, with no derivation in between. Opening it
 * therefore requires no assumption at all: the key either opens it or it does
 * not. It is also the value that actually broke, the only encrypted value the
 * broken workspace held, and the first ciphertext most workspaces ever write — a
 * workspace mints it on the first request that signs anything, long before it
 * connects an integration.
 *
 * The row is read with the library's own opener rather than a local
 * reimplementation, for the same reason `vendor/fleet-secrets.ts` is pinned
 * byte-for-byte: a second copy of a decrypt is a second copy that can drift, and
 * the drift shows up as a refusal on a healthy workspace.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not decide anything. `absent` is not "pass" and `unopenable` is not
 * "refuse" — those are the verdict's to make, in one place, in `fingerprint.ts`.
